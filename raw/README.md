## .geojson & .json files to transform

Place your geojson and json files you want to convert into nice metacard artifacts here.

You may take one large file with hundreds of geo artifacts and they will be each split into individual metacards as standard in DDF

Once processing is complete, you will find the resulting file/s in ```transformed```
