## .geojson & .json files to transform

###### Data Files
- Place your geojson and json files you want to convert into nice metacard artifacts here in ```/raw```
- You may take one large file with hundreds of geo artifacts and they will be each split into individual metacards as standard in DDF
- Run the script


###### On Completion
Once processing is complete, you will find the resulting file/s in ```transformed```
